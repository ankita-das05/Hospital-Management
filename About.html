                <h1>Background</h1>
                
                <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">CIn the early 1990s, the Government of West Bengal was looking for a private
                     operator to take charge of Niramoy, a state-owned polyclinic at Dhakuria. 
                     Accordingly, the rights of management were handed over to a city-based 
                     private player. Soon after, the Emami Group was invited on board and the 
                     Advanced Medicare & Research Institute Ltd., a super specialty hospital, 
                     came into being, with the express purpose of offering quality healthcare.
<br><br>
                    In 2009, the hospital’s name was officially changed to AMRI Hospitals 
                    Limited and within a short period, the Emami Group took control of the whole 
                    private healthcare group. The most visible value the tag of ‘Emami’ brought to 
                    the table is a brand of passionate entrepreneurship and over time the Group 
                    leveraged its indomitable spirit to extend the benefits of quality health care to 
                    millions across the region.
                    <br><br>
                    With growing awareness among the citizenry about modern medicine, 
                    a greater need for superior healthcare services emerged in Eastern India. 
                    The Emami Group used its drive for inclusive growth and acumen for business 
                    innovation to expand across Eastern and North Eastern India, entering new specialty 
                    segments and attracting doctors, who while hailing from India, came with global
                     exposure and international standard skills.
                    <br><br>
                    As the CITY Hospitals emerged a premier healthcare service provider,
                     the growth was not just about doing things better than the others;
                      it was about introducing a transformative experience. For the first
                       time in Eastern India, the Group brought to the operating table latest 
                       technologies, advanced equipment, high-class facilities, and the competence 
                       to synergize all these elements. The growth of AMRI Hospitals has become 
                       historically significant in the region, as it paved the path for private
                        healthcare with a corporate approach.</p>
